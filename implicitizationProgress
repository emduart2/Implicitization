I'm working on including the examples functions into the implicitization package.
I have included and modified the names so that the names in the Package make more sense
 Included functions with new names:
 restest->genericMap
 kbpts -> kpoints Note: Still need to figure out how to input the polynomial ring in this case.

Made some changes to the kpoints code to run it with the ring, it still has some bugs inside
the function. For some reason M2 doesn't like it.
